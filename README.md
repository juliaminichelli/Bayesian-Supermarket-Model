This project is part of the coursework of Modern Computational Statistics (CS146), taken at Minerva Schools at KGI on Spring 2020. It is a location-based assignment. It applies Bayesian statistics and modeling, using Monte Carlo Markov Chains (MCMC) through PyStan.

The goal of the project is to model the cost of groceries in different neighborhoods of Buenos Aires, Taipei and San Francisco. Does the store brand affect product prices, or not? Are grocery prices and the geographical distribution of different grocery stores correlated with other cost-of-living measures in a city â€“ for example, rent and real estate prices?
